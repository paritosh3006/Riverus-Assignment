155,155,The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.,
156,156,disappointed.,

158,158,"What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...",
159,159,Works great!.,
160,160,The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.,

168,168,I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.,
169,169,I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.,
170,170,I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.,
171,171,"Great price, too!",
172,172,Razr Battery - Good buy.,

210,210,awesome device.,
211,211,Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.,
212,212,Great product for the price!.,
213,213,These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.,
214,214,Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.,
215,215,It's not what it says it is.,
216,216,im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.,
217,217,Very Displeased.,
218,218,I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.,
219,219,"It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.",

241,241,This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.,

255,255,Not a good bargain.,

270,270,Buy a different phone - but not this.,
271,271,"useless phone, simply deaf.",

274,274,"When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.",
275,275,"Great product, fast shipping!.",
276,276,The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.,
277,277,"However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.",
278,278,This battery is an excellent bargain!,
279,279,I want my money back.,
280,280,What a waste of money and time!.,
281,281,The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).,
282,282,"Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.",
283,283,"Audio Quality is poor, very poor.",
284,284,The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.,

292,292,I highly recommend this device to everyone!,
293,293,For the price this was a great deal.,
294,294,Doesn't Work.,
295,295,I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.,
296,296,"It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.",
297,297,"It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.",
298,298,"I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use",
299,299,Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.,
300,300,Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.,
301,301,its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.,
302,302,Works great.,
303,303,"The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.",
304,304,"A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.",
305,305,The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.,
306,306,Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far.,
307,307,My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.,
308,308,All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.,
309,309,WORST PHONE EVER.,
310,310,Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!,

314,314,"If you hate earbugs, avoid this phone by all means.",
315,315,I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.,
316,316,"I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.",

327,327,the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!,
328,328,Basically the service was very bad.,
329,329,I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.,
330,330,REALLY UGLY.,
331,331,I could not recommend these more.,
332,332,"Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.",
333,333,So just beware.,

349,349,"Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.",
350,350,"Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !",
351,351,The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.,
352,352,I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.,
353,353,This phone works great.,
354,354,Really good product.,
355,355,Worked perfectly!,
356,356,Great phone.,
357,357,I Was Hoping for More.,
358,358,Bad Reception.,
359,359,Doesn't do the job.,
360,360,Soyo technology sucks.,
361,361,"The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.",
362,362,cool phone.,
363,363,The design is very good.4.,
364,364,It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.,
365,365,don't waste your money.,
366,366,"Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.",
367,367,We are sending it back.,
368,368,A Disappointment.,
369,369,"All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.",
370,370,I'm still infatuated with this phone.,
371,371,I great reception all the time.,
372,372,"Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.",
373,373,This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.,
374,374,Does everything it should and more.,
375,375,Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.,
376,376,"Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.",
377,377,The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.,
378,378,Perfect for the PS3.,
379,379,"Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear.",
380,380,"Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!",
381,381,"If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!",
382,382,Unreliable - I'm giving up.,
383,383,Battery is terrible.,
384,384,I'm very disappointed with my decision.,
385,385,Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.,
386,386,These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.,
387,387,It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.,
388,388,Someone shouldve invented this sooner.,
389,389,This is a great phone!.,
390,390,"I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.",
391,391,I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.,
392,392,good protection and does not make phone too bulky.,
393,393,"First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.",
394,394,I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.,
395,395,They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.,
396,396,Has been working great.,
397,397,Love this headset!,
398,398,doesn't last long.,
399,399,Very prompt service.,
400,400,#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.,
401,401,Chinese Forgeries Abound!.,

403,403,"The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.",
404,404,Good transmit audio.,
405,405,Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.,
406,406,No real improvement.,
407,407,Poor quality.,
408,408,Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!,
409,409,I had to purchase a different case.,
410,410,Poor Reliability.,
411,411,NOT WHAT I WANTED.,
412,412,Disappointed with battery.,
413,413,Poor sound quality.,
414,414,Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!,
415,415,Very disappointing.,
416,416,Poor product.,
417,417,Don't buy it.,
418,418,Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.,
419,419,Happy so far!.,
420,420,I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.,
421,421,Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.,
422,422,Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory,
423,423,The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.,
424,424,Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.,
425,425,You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.,
426,426,Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.,
427,427,I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.,
428,428,One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.,
429,429,Works good.,
430,430,it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.,
431,431,After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.,
432,432,Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.,
433,433,It was horrible!.,
434,434,IT'S REALLY EASY.,
435,435,Warning - Stay away.,
436,436,I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.,
437,437,"As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.",
438,438,It is a joy to use.,
439,439,VERY comfortable.,
440,440,worthless product.,
441,441,I would recommend this.,
442,442,"I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.",
443,443,I bought two of them and neither will charge.,
444,444,Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.,
445,445,poor quality and service.,
446,446,Just does not work.,
447,447,Best headset ever!!!.,
448,448,All in all I think it was a good investment.,
449,449,Blue Ant is easy to use.,
450,450,DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS,
451,451,"They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.",
452,452,"I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.",
453,453,"Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.",
454,454,So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.,
455,455,I'm returning them.,
456,456,Great Earpiece.,
457,457,I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.,
458,458,New Battery works great in phone.,
459,459,Fantastic earphones.,
460,460,Now I know that I made a wise decision.,
461,461,It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.,
462,462,"Terrible product, and waste of money!",
463,463,Better than expected.,
464,464,Waste of money.,
465,465,There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.,
466,466,"The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.",
467,467,"Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.",
468,468,This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.,
469,469,I love this device.,
470,470,Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.,
471,471,"Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.",
472,472,"I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.",
473,473,"At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).",
474,474,"I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure.",
475,475,It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.,
476,476,Works great!.,
477,477,Everything about this product is wrong.First,
478,478,I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.,
479,479,Battery life is also great!,
480,480,The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.,
481,481,Worst ever.,
482,482,Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!,
483,483,I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.,
484,484,Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is,
485,485,Never got it!!!!!,
486,486,THAT one didn't work either.,
487,487,It does everything the description said it would.,
488,488,"Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.",
489,489,EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.,
490,490,Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..,
491,491,"It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.",
492,492,"Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.",
493,493,Product is exactly as described.,
494,494,Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.,
495,495,"Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life.",
496,496,"But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.",
497,497,"If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.",
498,498,Awsome Device Works Great!!.,
499,499,An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.,
500,500,I love this thing!,
501,501,I found this product to be waaay too big.,
502,502,The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.,
503,503,I would have given no star if I was able.,
504,504,The reception is excellent!,
505,505,It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.,
506,506,I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.,
507,507,How can that be?The audio quality is poor.,
508,508,Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.,
509,509,"It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.",
510,510,You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.,
511,511,Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.,
512,512,Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.,
513,513,"Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.",
514,514,"After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.",
515,515,Having trouble with volume.,
516,516,Will order from them again!,
517,517,Excellent sound quality.,
518,518,The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.,

520,520,This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier.,
521,521,What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.,
522,522,These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.,
523,523,I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.,
524,524,The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.,
525,525,Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.,
526,526,Customer service was terrible.,
527,527,This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.,
528,528,Nice headset priced right.,
529,529,A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.,
530,530,They do not care about the consumer one bit.,
531,531,Great phone.,
532,532,Good case!.,
533,533,Very good stuff for the price.,
534,534,The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.,
535,535,It's AGGRAVATING!,
536,536,Easy to use.,
537,537,what a disappointment,
538,538,"good item, low price.",
539,539,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.,
540,540,Absolutel junk.,
541,541,"It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.",
542,542,The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.,
543,543,A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.,
544,544,I'll be looking for a new earpiece.,
545,545,W810i is just SUPERB.,
546,546,Don't bother - go to the store.,
547,547,I only hear garbage for audio.,
548,548,I don't like this Nokia either.,
549,549,So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.,
550,550,This fixes all the problems.,
551,551,It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.,
552,552,O my gosh the best phone I have ever had.,
553,553,The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.,
554,554,Painful on the ear.,
555,555,Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.,
556,556,[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!,
557,557,Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.,
558,558,"The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.",
559,559,The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.,
560,560,I love this phone!.,
561,561,Not as good as I had hoped.,
562,562,"My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.",

567,567,I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.,
568,568,"very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.",
569,569,"Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!",
570,570,My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.,
571,571,It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality.,
572,572,"It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.",
573,573,"Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.",
574,574,Plug was the wrong size.,
575,575,I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.,
576,576,I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.,
577,577,This device is great in several situations:1.),
578,578,Pretty piece of junk.,
579,579,"It felt too light and ""tinny."".",
580,580,Please dont waste your money.,
581,581,"There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.",
582,582,"All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.",
583,583,"The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.",
584,584,"I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!",
585,585,If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.,
586,586,I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.,
587,587,It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.,
588,588,Waste of 13 bucks.,
589,589,"While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.",
590,590,This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.,
591,591,Excellent!.,
592,592,It has been a winner for us.,
593,593,"My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!",
594,594,The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.,

606,606,":-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.",
607,607,The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.,
608,608,Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.,
609,609,Also makes it easier to hold on to.,
610,610,So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.,
611,611,Good product - incredible value.,
612,612,"Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.",
613,613,But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.,
614,614,clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.,

620,620,AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.,
621,621,I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.,
622,622,The ear buds only play music in one ear.,
623,623,I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).,

629,629,"Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had.",

648,648,It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.,
649,649,I was very impressed with the price of the cases.,
650,650,And none of the tones is acceptable.,
651,651,"It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.",
652,652,Returned 8 hours later.,
653,653,Doesn't hold charge.,
654,654,"That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.",
655,655,Protects the phone on all sides.,
656,656,In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.,
657,657,Worth every penny.,
658,658,I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.,
659,659,"In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?",
660,660,Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.,

664,664,"Needless to say, I wasted my money.",
665,665,This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.,
666,666,Battery charge-life is quite long.,
667,667,if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.,
668,668,Disapointing Results.,
669,669,We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros,
670,670,"The range is very decent, I've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues.",

680,680,It is very comfortable on the ear.,
681,681,I received it quickly and it works great!!,
682,682,I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.,

684,684,I would not recommend this item to anyone.,
685,685,The item received was Counterfeit.,

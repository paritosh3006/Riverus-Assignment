0,i exchanged the sony ericson za for this and i'm pretty happy with that decision,1
1,oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone,1

237,great audio,1

241,this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive,1

266,that company is a joke,0
267,i only used it two days and it wasn't always easy to hear with,0

269,excellent bluetooth headset,1
270,buy a different phone - but not this,1
271,useless phone simply deaf,1
272,i wear glasses and it fits fine with them,1
273,the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda),0

275,great product fast shipping,1
276,the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase,1
277,however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up,0
278,this battery is an excellent bargain,1
279,i want my money back,1
280,what a waste of money and time,0
281,the volume for the ringer is real good (you have choices how loud),1
282,works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen,1
283,audio quality is poor very poor,0
284,the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity,1

295,i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway,0
296,it plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it's not,0
297,it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality,0
298,i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use,1
299,yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design,1
300,appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my vi,1
301,its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it,0
303,the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very  appealing,1
304,a week later after i activated it it suddenly died,0
305,the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena,0
306,only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far,0
307,my phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand,1
308,all it took was one drop from about  inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing,1
309,worst phone ever,0
310,think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me,0
311,car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended,1
312,and the sound quality is great,1
313,this item is fantastic and works perfectly,1
314,if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means,0

321,unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone s despite connecting it from multiple power sources (imac external battery wall outlet etc),1
322,the text messaging feature is really tricky to use,1
323,better than new,0
324,* comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals (seriously,1
325,muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off,0
326,i love all the features and form factor,1
327,the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone,0
328,basically the service was very bad,0
329,i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price,1
330,really ugly,0
331,i could not recommend these more,1
332,other than that the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape,1
333,so just beware,0
334,i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldn't produce my receipt i was out of luck,1

375,motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right,0
376,voice quality signal strength dropped calls,0

429,works good,1
430,it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger,0
431,after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well,1

434,it's really easy,1
435,warning - stay away,0
436,i wish i could return the unit and get back my money,0

464,waste of money,0
465,there's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before,0
466,the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint,0
467,overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman,1
468,this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear,0
469,i love this device,1
470,works like a charm; it work the same as the one i got with the phone,1
471,plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point,1
472,i put the latest os on it (vg) and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while,0
473,at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at $ until i plugged it into my phone (vc razr),1
474,i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx- series  which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure,1
475,it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal,0
477,everything about this product is wrongfirst,1
478,i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare,1
479,battery life is also great,1

492,bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked,1
493,product is exactly as described,1
494,its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color,1
495,comfortable nice range good battery life,1
496,but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product,0
497,if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one,0
498,awsome device works great,1

508,their research and development division obviously knows what they're doing,1
509,it has a great camera thats mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality,1
510,you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered,0
511,everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good,1
512,integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone,1
513,well packaged arrived on time and works as intended,0
514,after my phone got to be about a year old it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part,1
515,having trouble with volume,0

517,excellent sound quality,1
518,the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad,0
519,i definitly recommend,1
520,this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier,0
521,what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone,0
522,these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent,1
523,i had verizon  years ago and really liked their service,1
524,the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over  years ago,1
525,gets a signal when other verizon phones won't,1
526,customer service was terrible,0

541,it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission,1
542,the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face,1
543,a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me,0
544,i'll be looking for a new earpiece,0
545,wi is just superb,1
546,don't bother - go to the store,0
547,i only hear garbage for audio,0
548,i don't like this nokia either,1
549,so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing,0
550,this fixes all the problems,0
551,it has everything i need and i couldn't ask for more,1
552,o my gosh the best phone i have ever had,1
553,the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears,1
554,painful on the ear,0
555,not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look,0
556,[] down the drain because of a weak snap,0
557,disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer,0

561,not as good as i had hoped,1
562,my father has the v and the battery is dying,1
563,good show samsung,1
564,the noise shield is incrediable,0

566,as many people complained i found this headset's microphone was very weak,0
567,i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap,0
568,very clear quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset,1
569,couldn't use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas,1
570,my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect,1
571,it's very attractive and appears to be of good quality,1
572,it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them,0
573,finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor,1
574,plug was the wrong size,0
575,i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately,1
576,i used to talk on it for  -  / hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying,0
577,this device is great in several situations:),1
578,pretty piece of junk,0
579,it felt too light and tinny,1
580,please dont waste your money,0
581,there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake,1
582,all in all i'm quite satisfied with this purchase,1
583,the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking,1
584,i would definitely recommend the jabra btv for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price,1
585,if the two were seperated by a mere  ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset,1
586,i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics,1
587,it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is,0
588,waste of  bucks,0
589,while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop,1
590,this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used,1
591,excellent,1
592,it has been a winner for us,1
593,my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra (which i hated,0

607,the worst phone i've ever had only had it for a few months,0
608,their network coverage in los angeles is horrible,0
609,also makes it easier to hold on to,0
610,so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation,0
611,good product - incredible value,1
612,also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down,0
613,but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before,1
614,clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like  cent's up-and-coming,1
615,defective crap,0
616,but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then i'm lost,0
617,this product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it,0
618,dont waste your money,0

620,after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days,0
621,i didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me,1

651,it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip,1
652,returned  hours later,0
653,doesn't hold charge,0
654,that being said for a phone the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well,1
655,protects the phone on all sides,1
656,in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement,1
657,worth every penny,1
658,i received my supposedly new motorola  and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger,0
659,in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa - is that the new phone on tv,0
660,highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone,1
661,i'm pleased,1
662,i usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair,0
663,who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery,1
664,needless to say i wasted my money,0
665,this does not fit the palm tungsten e and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in,0
666,battery charge-life is quite long,0
667,if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre,1
668,disapointing results,0
669,we have tried  units and they both failed within  months pros,0
670,the range is very decent i've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues,1
671,so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter,0
672,definitely a bargain,1
673,truly awful,0
674,arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold,0
675,it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case,1
676,camera color balance is awful,0
677,i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing,0
678,first of all it doesn't wear well,0
679,it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon,0
680,it is very comfortable on the ear,1
681,i received it quickly and it works great,1
682,i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and  is pretty comfortible to wear  hours a day without pain in the ear,1
683,cumbersome design,1
684,i would not recommend this item to anyone,1
685,the item received was counterfeit,1
686,i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside,1
687,restored my phone to like new performance,1
688,don't buy this product,1
689,they keep getting better and better (this is my third one and i've had numerous palms too),1
690,dont buy it,0
691,great price also,1
692,the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all,1
693,works like a charm works as advertised,0
694,you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not,1
695,very good phone,1
696,so far it has worked like a charm,1
697,it works fine on my motorola  cellphone and a lot better than the worn-out battery did,1
698,buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet,1
699,the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low,0
701,this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible,0
702,i am glad i purchased it,0
703,the mic is great,1
704,buttons are too small,1
705,the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked,1
706,i'm using it with an iriver spinn (with case) and it fits fine,1
707,that's a huge design flaw (unless i'm not using it correctly which i don't think is the case),0
708,the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary,1
709,none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly,0
710,fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips,1
711,i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute,1
712,those phones are working just fine now,1
713,bad choice,0
714,if you don't find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone,0
715,then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping,1
716,i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem,0
717,works fine,1
718,good case excellent value,1
719,the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work,0
720,i would recommend it,1
721,clear skype calls long battery life long range,1
722,comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day,0
723,excellent product for the price,1
725,i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it,1
726,setup went very smoothly,1
727,the phone loads super,1
729,linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something,0

732,i've had this for nearly  years and it has worked great for me,1

737,i am also very happy with the price,1
738,clear crisp sound,1
739,made very sturdy,1
740,for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend,1

742,excellent dual-purpose headset,1

745,used and dirty,0
746,iam very pleased with my purchase,1
748,a pretty good product,1
749,not worth it,1
750,i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well,1
751,leopard print is wonderfully wild,1
752,i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that i've got it i couldn't be happier,1
753,this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon,0
754,no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever,0
755,it has all the features i want,1
756,plan on ordering from them again and again,1
757,this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had sound-wise,0
758,it's a piece of crap,0
759,as i said abovepretty useless,0
760,because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all,0
761,poor talk time performance,0
762,it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics  maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use,0
763,i would highly recommend this,1
764,it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes,0
765,the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e is the worst i have ever seeen,0
766,i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more,0
768,they are so cool,1
769,the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome,1
770,i can hear while i'm driving in the car and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting,0
771,i connected my wife's bluetooth(motorola hs) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case,1
772,performed awful -- muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call,0
773,the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent,1
774,do not buy if you want to use the holster,1
775,piece of trash,0
776,this is hands down the best phone i've ever had,1
777,the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly,1
778,the phone gets extremely hot,1
779,krussel always good,1
780,the plug did not work very well,0
781,so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it,1
782,they refuse to refund or replace,0
783,the battery life is highly unacceptable,1
784,no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid,0
785,the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing,0
786,this product is very high quality chinese crap,0
787,i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat,1
788,great choice,1

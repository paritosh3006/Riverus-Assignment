0,i exchanged the sony ericson za for this and i'm pretty happy with that decision
1,oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone
2,verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard re-set wiping out all my data
3,better than you'd expect
4,this is a great little item
5,nice case feels good in your hands
6,do not make the same mistake as me
7,however i needed some better instructions
8,nice design and quality
9,it was a waste of my money
10,this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer
11,this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate
12,how stupid is that
13,the phone is sturdy and waterproof
14,the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature
15,what a big waste of time
16,another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model
17,bad fit way too big
18,you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once
19,you won't regret it
20,it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable
21,the commercials are the most misleading
22,i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt
23,this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up
24,great sound and service
25,i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my  blackberry curve
26,does not fit
27,i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone
28,it is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it
29,i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and it's a great color
30,battery is holding up well
31,best bluetooth on the market
32,but it is great i would really recommend it
33,jawbone era is awesome too
34,i've bought $ wired headphones that sound better than these
35,i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery
36,this case seems well made
37,i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones
38,if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isn't it
39,i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead
40,seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors
41,this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone
42,it has kept up very well
43,love this product
44,due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset
45,when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off
46,it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset
47,i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good
48,the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again
49,price is good too
50,perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this
51,it looks very nice
52,the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast
53,this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something
54,everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie
55,trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration
56,yes it's shiny on front side - and i love it
57,great phone
58,nice docking station for home or work
59,works great
60,it didn't charge for me
61,i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great
62,i've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it
63,this blueant supertooth hands-free phone speaker is awesome
64,improper description i had to return it
65, long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)
66,the picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today
67,however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons
68,small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place
69,after  months screen just went black all of a sudden
70,unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect
71,virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone
72,i would highly recommend this product
73,good price
74,i'm a bit disappointed
75,great for using with your home stereo
76,these are fabulous
77,bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing
78,disappointing
79,i own  of these cases and would order another
80,great for the jawbone
81,looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment
82,i can't use this case because the smell is disgusting
83,terrible my car will not accept this cassette
84,they work about  weeks then break
85,lightweight and works well
86,i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product
87,i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well
88,the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad
89,this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching
90,i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone
91,i've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one i've found that fits my ear comfortably
92,this is a great deal
93,one of my favorite purchases ever
94,terrible phone holder
95,you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly
96,excellent product
97,i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging
98,for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does
99,i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful
100,can't upload ringtones from a third party
101,i went on motorola's website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again
102,i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip
103,horrible had to switch  times
104,you get what you pay for i guess
105,saggy floppy piece of junk
106,don't waste your money
107,great hands free device
108,superb phone on a great network
109,you could only take  videos at a time and the quality was very poor
110,(it works)
111,the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone
112,i'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price
113,the phone was unusable and was not new
114,well im satisfied
115,works for me
116,the nokia ca- usb cable did not work with my phone
117,very pleased with this headset
118,good quality
119,not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should
120,t-mobile has the best customer service anywhere
121,i'm really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesn't work
122,also difficult to put oni'd recommend avoiding this product
123,excellent starter wireless headset
124,i am very happy
125,worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would
126,all three broke within two months of use
127,not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it
128,all in all i'd expected a better consumer experience from motorola
129,thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price
130,it didn't work people can not hear me when i talk
131,excellent phone
132,poor construction
133,bluetooth range is good - a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch
134,a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget
135,i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family
136,people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone
138,the microphone also works well but (according to people i have called) it applifies everything
139,would recommend this item
140,i gave it  stars because of the sound quality
141,essentially you can forget microsoft's tech support
142,it worked very well
143,i wasted my little money with this earpiece
144,plantronics bluetooth excelent buy
145,then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem
146,this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts
147,the replacement died in a few weeks
148,display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year
149, thumbs up to this seller
150, item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung sch-r slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs
151,incredible
152,product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper
153,it definitely was not as good as my s
154,very satisifed with that
155,the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service
156,disappointed
157,the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset
158,what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea
160,the one big drawback of the mp player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds
161,you'll love how thin it is
162,the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off
163,the case is great and works fine with the 
164,it was quite comfortable in the ear
165,provides good protection and looks classy too
166,it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days
167,problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily
168,i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking
169,i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume
170,i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone
171,great price too
172,razr battery - good buy
173,my headset works just peachy-keen
174,i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source
175,keep up the good work amazon
176,it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed
177,sending it back
178,this is a good battery and it got here really fast
179,every thing on phone work perfectly she like it
180,this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems
181,could not get strong enough signal
182,don't make the same mistake i did
183,great product and price
184,we have gotten a lot of compliments on it
185,freezes frequently
186,it's a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync  for optimal data synchronization results
187,however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls
188,great value
189,reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be
190,horrible horrible protector
191,same problem as others have mentioned
192,obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for
193,it's fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable
194,not impressed
195,however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does
196,i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off
197,i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it
198,works well
199,i didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort
200,if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing
201,the shipping time was also very quick
202,really pleased with this product so far
203,headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage
204,the igo chargers and tips are really great
205,don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support
206,great for ipods too
207,the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics
208,none of it works just don't buy it
209,i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for  seconds and it still works great
210,awesome device
211,buyer--be very careful
212,great product for the price
213,these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet
214,mobile phone tools are a must have
215,it's not what it says it is
216,im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it
217,very displeased
218,i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work
219,it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time
220,worst customer service
221,thank you for such great service
222,five star plus plus
223,after receiving and using the product for just  days it broke
224,i've had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions
225,the buttons for on and off are bad
226,the instruction manual is lacking
227,i used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent
228,it's pretty easy
229,so far so good
230,obviously there is a problem with the adhesive
231,i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great
232,i love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-usb device to my pc
233,this item worked great but it broke after  months of use
234,it's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out
235,i wouldn't recommend buying this product
236,i was not impressed by this product
237,great audio
238,this is a beautiful phone
239,the camera although rated at an impressive  megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution
240,product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the  cellphones i was planning to use it with
241,this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive
242,good audio quality
243,treo and t-mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount
244,the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp
245,very good quality though
246,however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one
247,does not work for listening to music with the cingular 
248,i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool
249,the pleather case doesn't fit
250,amazon sucks
251,i love my  headset my jabra bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit
252,if you are razr owneryou must have this
253,it's a great item
254,sprint charges for this service
255,not a good bargain
256,best i've found so far  i've tried  other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using
257,talk about useless customer service
258,this one works and was priced right
259,this phone might well be the worst i've ever had in any brand
260,it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap
261,i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it
262,this is the first phone i've had that has been so cheaply made
263,low quality
264,this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving
265,a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for  days
266,that company is a joke
267,i only used it two days and it wasn't always easy to hear with
268,unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening
269,excellent bluetooth headset
270,buy a different phone - but not this
271,useless phone simply deaf
272,i wear glasses and it fits fine with them
273,the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda)
274,when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides
275,great product fast shipping
276,the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase
277,however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up
278,this battery is an excellent bargain
279,i want my money back
280,what a waste of money and time
281,the volume for the ringer is real good (you have choices how loud)
282,works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen
283,audio quality is poor very poor
284,the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity
285,i love this phone  it is very handy and has a lot of features 
286,the reception through this headset is excellent
287,gets the job done
288,no ear loop needed it's tiny and the sound is great
289,excellent hands free tool
290,the battery runs down quickly
291,bad purchase
292,i highly recommend this device to everyone
293,for the price this was a great deal
294,doesn't work
295,i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway
296,it plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it's not
297,it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality
298,i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use
299,yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design
300,appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my vi
301,its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it
303,the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very  appealing
304,a week later after i activated it it suddenly died
305,the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena
306,only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far
307,my phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand
308,all it took was one drop from about  inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing
309,worst phone ever
310,think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me
311,car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended
312,and the sound quality is great
313,this item is fantastic and works perfectly
314,if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means
315,i love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell
316,i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds  feet line of sight
317,also the area where my unit broke)- i'm not too fond of the magnetic strap
318,earbud piece breaks easily
319,i am more than happy with this product
320,couldn't figure it out
321,unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone s despite connecting it from multiple power sources (imac external battery wall outlet etc)
322,the text messaging feature is really tricky to use
323,better than new
324,* comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals (seriously
325,muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off
326,i love all the features and form factor
327,the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone
328,basically the service was very bad
329,i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price
330,really ugly
331,i could not recommend these more
332,other than that the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape
333,so just beware
334,i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldn't produce my receipt i was out of luck
335,i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since
336,i have read other's reviews here but i haven't had any problem with it
337,very much disappointed with this company
338,not good enough for the price
339,i also didn't like the on button it felt like it would crack with use
340,this pda rocks
341,i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine
342,i especially love the long battery life
343,phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are
344,good  works fine
345,very disappointed
346,not enough volume
347,much better than the hard plastic cases
348,piece of junk
349,not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection
350,sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 
351,the best electronics of the available fm transmitters
352,i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great
353,this phone works great
354,really good product
355,worked perfectly
357,i was hoping for more
358,bad reception
359,doesn't do the job
360,soyo technology sucks
361,the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc
362,cool phone
363,the design is very good
364,it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed
366,otherwise easy to install and use clear sound
367,we are sending it back
368,a disappointment
369,all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it
370,i'm still infatuated with this phone
371,i great reception all the time
372,overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception
373,this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network
374,does everything it should and more
375,motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right
376,voice quality signal strength dropped calls
377,the plastic breaks really easy on this clip
378,perfect for the ps
379,using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear
380,great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected
381,if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you
382,unreliable - i'm giving up
383,battery is terrible
384,i'm very disappointed with my decision
385,not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player
386,these headphones were a great find - and i think they are perhaps the best purchase i've made in the last several years - seriously
387,it's been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound; good volume; good noise cancellation
388,someone shouldve invented this sooner
389,this is a great phone
390,i love the camera it's really pretty good quality
391,i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked
392,good protection and does not make phone too bulky
393,first off the reception sucks i have never had more than  bars ever
394,i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp players in the family
395,they made this case too small and is very difficult to install
396,has been working great
397,love this headset
398,doesn't last long
399,very prompt service
400,# it works - # it is comfortable
401,chinese forgeries abound
402,bad quality
403,the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently
404,good transmit audio
405,case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear
406,no real improvement
407,poor quality
408,authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 
409,i had to purchase a different case
410,poor reliability
411,not what i wanted
412,disappointed with battery
413,poor sound quality
414,tied to charger for conversations lasting more than  minutesmajor problems
415,very disappointing
416,poor product
417,don't buy it
418,lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone
419,happy so far
420,i've owned this phone for  months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone i've had
421,phone now holds charge like it did when it was new
422,echo problemvery unsatisfactory
423,the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap
424,makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when i'm not wearing it
425,you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs
426,doesn't work at all i bougth it for my lc and its not working
427,i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear
428,one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side
429,works good
430,it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger
431,after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well
432,also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case
433,it was horrible
434,it's really easy
435,warning - stay away
436,i wish i could return the unit and get back my money
437,as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens
438,it is a joy to use
439,very comfortable
440,worthless product
441,i would recommend this
442,i still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones we just obviously don't share enough dna to copy the design over to humans
443,i bought two of them and neither will charge
444,much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with
445,poor quality and service
446,just does not work
447,best headset ever
448,all in all i think it was a good investment
449,blue ant is easy to use
450,do not buy do not buyit sucks
451,they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried
452,i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better
453,best of all is the rotating feature very helpful
454,so i bought about  of these and saved alot of money
455,i'm returning them
456,great earpiece
457,i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and i'm very happy with my purchase
458,new battery works great in phone
459,fantastic earphones
460,now i know that i made a wise decision
461,it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it
462,terrible product and waste of money
463,better than expected
464,waste of money
465,there's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before
466,the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint
467,overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman
468,this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear
469,i love this device
470,works like a charm; it work the same as the one i got with the phone
471,plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point
472,i put the latest os on it (vg) and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while
473,at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at $ until i plugged it into my phone (vc razr)
474,i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx- series  which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure
475,it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal
477,everything about this product is wrongfirst
478,i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare
479,battery life is also great
480,the ngage is still lacking in earbuds
481,worst ever
482,too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service
483,i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic
484,fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is
485,never got it
486,that one didn't work either
487,it does everything the description said it would
488,light weight i hardly notice it is there
489,excellent service
490,any ring toneoverall good phone to buy
491,it lasts less than o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem
492,bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked
493,product is exactly as described
494,its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color
495,comfortable nice range good battery life
496,but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product
497,if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one
498,awsome device works great
499,an awesome new look for fall 
500,i love this thing
501,i found this product to be waaay too big
502,the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips
503,i would have given no star if i was able
504,the reception is excellent
505,it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two
506,i received my headset in good time and was happy with it
507,how can that bethe audio quality is poor
508,their research and development division obviously knows what they're doing
509,it has a great camera thats mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality
510,you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered
511,everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good
512,integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone
513,well packaged arrived on time and works as intended
514,after my phone got to be about a year old it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part
515,having trouble with volume
516,will order from them again
517,excellent sound quality
518,the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad
519,i definitly recommend
520,this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier
521,what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone
522,these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent
523,i had verizon  years ago and really liked their service
524,the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over  years ago
525,gets a signal when other verizon phones won't
526,customer service was terrible
527,this phone is pretty sturdy and i've never had any large problems with it
528,nice headset priced right
529,a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i
530,they do not care about the consumer one bit
532,good case
533,very good stuff for the price
534,the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear
535,it's aggravating
536,easy to use
537,what a disappointment
538,good item low price
539,do not purchase this phone
540,absolutel junk
541,it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission
542,the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face
543,a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me
544,i'll be looking for a new earpiece
545,wi is just superb
546,don't bother - go to the store
547,i only hear garbage for audio
548,i don't like this nokia either
549,so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing
550,this fixes all the problems
551,it has everything i need and i couldn't ask for more
552,o my gosh the best phone i have ever had
553,the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears
554,painful on the ear
555,not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look
556,[] down the drain because of a weak snap
557,disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer
558,the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high
559,the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them
560,i love this phone
561,not as good as i had hoped
562,my father has the v and the battery is dying
563,good show samsung
564,the noise shield is incrediable
565,i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed
566,as many people complained i found this headset's microphone was very weak
567,i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap
568,very clear quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset
569,couldn't use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas
570,my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect
571,it's very attractive and appears to be of good quality
572,it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them
573,finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor
574,plug was the wrong size
575,i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately
576,i used to talk on it for  -  / hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying
577,this device is great in several situations:)
578,pretty piece of junk
579,it felt too light and tinny
580,please dont waste your money
581,there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake
582,all in all i'm quite satisfied with this purchase
583,the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking
584,i would definitely recommend the jabra btv for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price
585,if the two were seperated by a mere  ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset
586,i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics
587,it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is
588,waste of  bucks
589,while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop
590,this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used
591,excellent
592,it has been a winner for us
593,my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra (which i hated
594,the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear
595,don't waste your $$$ on this one
596,he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery
597,it is simple to use and i like it
598,the instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used
599,it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time
600,was not happy
601,excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase
602,battery life still not long enough in motorola razor vi
603,this is infuriating
604,phone falls out easily
605,the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed
606,:-)oh the charger seems to work fine
607,the worst phone i've ever had only had it for a few months
608,their network coverage in los angeles is horrible
609,also makes it easier to hold on to
610,so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation
611,good product - incredible value
612,also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down
613,but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before
614,clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like  cent's up-and-coming
615,defective crap
616,but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then i'm lost
617,this product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it
618,dont waste your money
619,great case and price
620,after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days
621,i didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me
622,the ear buds only play music in one ear
623,i ordered this for sony ericsson wi but i think it only worked once (thats when i first used it)
624,the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter
625,sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone
626,it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call
627,the best phone in market :)
628,kind of flops around
629,just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had
630,cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item
631,the bt headset was such a disapoinment
632,battery lasts only a few hours
633,great pocket pc / phone combination
634,this is a great product sure beats using your fingers
635,the accompanied software is almost brilliant
636,comfortable in my hand
637,this is the phone to get for  i just bought my sa and all i can say is wow
638,this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful
639,the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too
640,do not buy for dwrongly advertised for d
641,still waiting i'm sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it
642,it also had a new problem
643,i've missed numerous calls because of this reason
644,comfort for our whole family
645,stay away from the q
646,the  mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good
647,were jerks on the phone
648,it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car
649,i was very impressed with the price of the cases
650,and none of the tones is acceptable
651,it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip
652,returned  hours later
653,doesn't hold charge
654,that being said for a phone the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well
655,protects the phone on all sides
656,in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement
657,worth every penny
658,i received my supposedly new motorola  and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger
659,in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa - is that the new phone on tv
660,highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone
661,i'm pleased
662,i usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair
663,who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery
664,needless to say i wasted my money
665,this does not fit the palm tungsten e and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in
666,battery charge-life is quite long
667,if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre
668,disapointing results
669,we have tried  units and they both failed within  months pros
670,the range is very decent i've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues
671,so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter
672,definitely a bargain
673,truly awful
674,arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold
675,it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case
676,camera color balance is awful
677,i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing
678,first of all it doesn't wear well
679,it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon
680,it is very comfortable on the ear
681,i received it quickly and it works great
682,i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and  is pretty comfortible to wear  hours a day without pain in the ear
683,cumbersome design
684,i would not recommend this item to anyone
685,the item received was counterfeit
686,i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside
687,restored my phone to like new performance
688,don't buy this product
689,they keep getting better and better (this is my third one and i've had numerous palms too)
690,dont buy it
691,great price also
692,the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all
693,works like a charm works as advertised
694,you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not
695,very good phone
696,so far it has worked like a charm
697,it works fine on my motorola  cellphone and a lot better than the worn-out battery did
698,buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet
699,the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low
701,this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible
702,i am glad i purchased it
703,the mic is great
704,buttons are too small
705,the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked
706,i'm using it with an iriver spinn (with case) and it fits fine
707,that's a huge design flaw (unless i'm not using it correctly which i don't think is the case)
708,the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary
709,none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly
710,fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips
711,i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute
712,those phones are working just fine now
713,bad choice
714,if you don't find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone
715,then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping
716,i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem
717,works fine
718,good case excellent value
719,the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work
720,i would recommend it
721,clear skype calls long battery life long range
722,comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day
723,excellent product for the price
725,i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it
726,setup went very smoothly
727,the phone loads super
729,linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something
730,nice sound
731,stay away from this store be careful
732,i've had this for nearly  years and it has worked great for me
733,sweetest phone
734,sprint - terrible customer service
735,this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality
737,i am also very happy with the price
738,clear crisp sound
739,made very sturdy
740,for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend
741,i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than  minutes before being disconnected
742,excellent dual-purpose headset
743,i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service
744,you can't beat the price on these
745,used and dirty
746,iam very pleased with my purchase
748,a pretty good product
749,not worth it
750,i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well
751,leopard print is wonderfully wild
752,i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that i've got it i couldn't be happier
753,this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon
754,no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever
755,it has all the features i want
756,plan on ordering from them again and again
757,this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had sound-wise
758,it's a piece of crap
759,as i said abovepretty useless
760,because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all
761,poor talk time performance
762,it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics  maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use
763,i would highly recommend this
764,it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes
765,the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e is the worst i have ever seeen
766,i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more
768,they are so cool
769,the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome
770,i can hear while i'm driving in the car and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting
771,i connected my wife's bluetooth(motorola hs) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case
772,performed awful -- muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call
773,the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent
774,do not buy if you want to use the holster
775,piece of trash
776,this is hands down the best phone i've ever had
777,the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly
778,the phone gets extremely hot
779,krussel always good
780,the plug did not work very well
781,so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it
782,they refuse to refund or replace
783,the battery life is highly unacceptable
784,no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid
785,the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing
786,this product is very high quality chinese crap
787,i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat
788,great choice
789,thank you for wasting my money
790,just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow
791,great product
792,this product is clearly not ready for prime time i don't care how cool it looks if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless
793,a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design
794,i give wirefly  stari will contact cingular/at&t; and inform them of this practice
795,last time buying from you
796,internet is excrutiatingly slow
797,lousy product
798,i'll be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason
799,i advise everyone do not be fooled
800,we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement
801,nice leather
802,i'm trying to return it for a refund
803,jabra ear gels r the best
804,it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside
805,voice recognition is tremendous
806,i cannot make calls at certain places
807,this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute
808,it's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an lg)
809,very wind-resistant
810,very good product well made
811,the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever
812,rip off---- over charge shipping
813,big disappointment with calendar sync
814,but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone
815,does not work
816,i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far
817,i wear it everyday and it holds up very well
818,don't make the same mistake that i did and please don't buy this phone
819,don't buy this product - it fails
820,you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off
821,battery has no life
822,i purchased this and within  days it was no longer working
823,the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well
824,magical help
825,)setup couldn't have been simpler
826,it fits my ear well and is comfortable on
827,all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul
828,save your money i've had this item for  months now
829,worst customer service ever
830,the battery is completely useless to me
831,mic doesn't work
832,design flaw
833,very unreliable service from t-mobile 
834,my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to (of )
835,don't waste your money and time
836,the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced
837,linked to my phone without effort
838,its not user friendly
839,pros:-good camera - very nice pictures  also has cool styles like black and white and more
840,you need at least  mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short
841,absolutely great
842,after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset
843,i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone
844,i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try
845,adapter does not provide enough charging current
846,good value works fine - power via usb car or wall outlet
847,i've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear
848,the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great
849,simple lightweight and great fit
850,it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last
851,love this phone
852,steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a three-pack
853,during several different  minute calls i experienced  drops and it was in an area that had  bars
854,battery life is real good
855,nice headphones for the price and they work great
856,i found the product to be easy to set up and use
857,its a total package
858,the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase
859,worked very well paired with a treo w and as a skype headset on my pc (using a usb bluetooth transceiver)
860,and i just love the colors
861,its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case
862,it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 
863,my -year old nokia  from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this
864,att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk
865,i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasn't great
866,i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best
867,i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal
